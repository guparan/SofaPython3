Welcome to SofaPython3 !
========================

The project is python3 binding for the Sofa simulation framework.
It is composed of one *Sofa plugin* and several *python modules*.

*Sofa plugin* embeds a python3 interpreter and a scene loader. This plugins allows you to load
a python interpreter in a sofa simulation to write Sofa scene directly using python. It also
permits to implement in python3 custom sofa component like ForceField, Controllers, Visitors.

Apart from the SofaPython3 plugin we also provide several *python modules* that exposes python different
parts of Sofa.

The general guidelines design for these binding was to be as much as possible idiomatic python3 API
and with tight integration for numpy.

General overview
-----------------
The Sofa python module:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Exposes the base Sofa object to build and manipulate a Sofa simulation.

- contains 4 submodules :
    - Sofa.Core, that contains bindings for scene components,
    - Sofa.Simulation, that contains functions to conduct simulation,
    - Sofa.Types, that contains default types available in Sofa,
    - Sofa.Helper, that contains utility functions.
- provides a copy-less API to access the sofa Data containers
- allows to implement custom sofa object (ForceField,  Controller) in python
- has docstring documentation

Try it: ```python import Sofa```

The SofaRuntime python module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- access the runtime specific stuff (GUI, GLViewers, runSofa internal status) [POC]
- docstring with sphinx content [TBD]

Try it: ```python import SofaRuntime```

Developer's environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- autogenerated documentation using sphinx [DONE]
- automated update the docs from the c++'s docstring: https://sofapython3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ [WIP]
- code completion with common editor [WIP, some editor are not working with c++ modules]


Execution environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- SofaPython3 is a plugin to include a python3 environment in a Sofa scene [DONE],

Try it: ```xml <RequiredPlugin='SofaPython3'/>```


- Sofa and SofaRuntime are the python module that can be imported in any python interpreter (python3, ipython, jupyter)[DONE], 

Try it: ```python python3 minimalscene.py```

- Access to Sofa simulation within the MathLab python interpreter [WIP-POC].  
- Make a full python GUI application (with UI framework like PySide2, pygame) and render an integrated sofa scene in an opengl context [POC]
